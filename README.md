# weather-forecasting-app

I developed a Python-based Weather Forecasting Application that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. The application provides users with current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and a 5-day forecast for any city worldwide. It features a user-friendly command-line interface and utilizes Python's requests and json libraries for API interaction and data parsing.
